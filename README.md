# Filter Optimizer

Filter Optimizer is a script that should run on the console of the [Site](https://www.innovasport.com/tenis-casuales-de-hombre/c/100010002070000000?q=%3Arelevance) which
easily replaces the style of the filter section.

| 8.28.2020     | Content Cell  | Test the original version of the script and understand its basic functionallity. | Some features are missing or not working as expected such as: sorting, it seems only sorting by color is working when clicking select. For example when selecting blue, it filters correctly but sorting by Brand: Adidas nothing happens. Price filter has no icon. |
