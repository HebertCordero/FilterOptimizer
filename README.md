# Filter Optimizer

Filter Optimizer is a script that should run on the console of the [Site](https://www.innovasport.com/tenis-casuales-de-hombre/c/100010002070000000?q=%3Arelevance) which
easily replaces the style of the filter section.

|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:--------------:|
| 8.28.2020     |  Test  | Test the original version of the script and understand its basic functionallity. | Some features are missing or not working as expected such as: sorting, it seems only sorting by color is working when clicking select. For example when selecting blue, it filters correctly but sorting by Brand: Adidas nothing happens. Some icons are missing. |
| 8.29.2020     | DnD Day | Uploaded the project to github to work on a different computer. |
| 8.30.2020     | Test | Understand the code completely | The code adds some new styles to the filter section, it seems some filter titles are orinnally Hidden but the code that runs when "Show more is clicked" removes the hidden property of those filters... Also today I finished documenting all the code in the script, this was necessary in order to understand the basic functionallity of the script. Tomorrow I will start with some optimizations I marked on the code in some comments, then i will work on some CSS JS erros that can easily be fixed. |
